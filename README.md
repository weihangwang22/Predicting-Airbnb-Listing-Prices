## Predicting Airbnb Listing Prices

In this project, I used R and machine learning techniques to predict Airbnb listing prices in six major American cities: New York City, Los Angeles, San Francisco, Chicago, Boston, and Washington, D.C. The main objectives of this project were to:

* Predict Airbnb listing prices accurately in six major American cities
* Identify the most important features that influence listing prices

To achieve these goals, I used a variety of regression techniques, including linear regression, random forest regression, and nerual networks, and compared their performance to select the best model.
